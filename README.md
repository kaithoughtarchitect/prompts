# Kai.ThoughtArquitect Prompt Collection

This repository contains a collection of my most advanced prompts and meta-systems designed for prompt engineering, debugging, evaluation, and specialized AI orchestration tasks.

## üß≠ Quick Start Guide

**New to prompt engineering?** Start with the [Dual Path Primer](./prompt_primer_and_evaluator/dual_path_primer/) to understand your requirements, then use the [Ultimate Prompt Evaluator](./prompt_primer_and_evaluator/UPE/) to refine your prompts.

**Building complex prompts from scratch in CLI/terminal environments?** Use the [Prompt Creation Trilogy](./prompt-creation-trilogy/) for systematic analysis, generation, and improvement. Designed specifically for Claude Code, Codex, and similar terminal-based AI development workflows.

**Debugging AI systems or code?** Try the [Adaptive Debug Protocol](./prompt-adaptive-debug-protocol/) for systematic problem-solving.

**Working with multi-agent AI systems?** Use the [Multi-Agent Orchestration Evaluator](./prompt-multi-agent-orchestration.evaluator/) for comprehensive system analysis.

## üìã Complete System Overview

### üîç The Ultimate Prompt Evaluator (UPE) v2
**Location:** `prompt_primer_and_evaluator/UPE/`

A comprehensive meta-prompt that provides 34-point evaluation of any prompt you submit. Features instant analysis, iterative refinement, and the ability to transform concepts into complete prompts.

**Key Features:**
- 34-criteria evaluation framework
- Iterative "re-evaluate" command for continuous improvement
- Concept-to-prompt transformation
- Platform-aware optimizations (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini)

**Best For:** Evaluating and refining existing prompts, quality assurance, prompt optimization

### üß† The Dual Path Primer
**Location:** `prompt_primer_and_evaluator/dual_path_primer/`

An AI meta-prompt orchestrator that refuses to proceed until it achieves 100% understanding of your request. Creates either perfectly contextualized conversations or highly optimized prompts.

**Key Features:**
- Active understanding pursuit with gap detection
- Structured "Readiness Report Table"
- Internal self-verification systems
- Dual output options (conversation or prompt)

**Best For:** Complex requirements gathering, creating context-rich prompts, setting up expert AI conversations

**Perfect Workflow:** Dual Path Primer ‚Üí UPE ‚Üí Deployment

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è The Prompt Creation Trilogy
**Location:** `prompt-creation-trilogy/`

A three-stage systematic approach: **Analyze ‚Üí Generate ‚Üí Improve**

#### 1. Multi-Framework Analyzer (`1-analyzer.md`)
Deep problem analysis using multiple frameworks (Ishikawa, Five Whys, OODA loops) before writing any prompts.

#### 2. Agentic Prompt Generator (`2-generator.md`)
Autonomous prompt architect that builds prompts iteratively, scoring its own work through 6 mandatory loops.

#### 3. Adaptive Prompt Improver (`3-improver.md`)
Takes any existing prompt and systematically enhances it to achieve 90%+ quality scores using domain-aware improvements.

**Best For:** Complex problem-solving, systematic prompt development, professional prompt engineering workflows

### üêõ Adaptive Debug Protocol
**Location:** `prompt-adaptive-debug-protocol/`

Military-grade debugging system using OODA loops (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) with escalating cognitive intensity for systematic problem-solving.

**Key Features:**
- Automatic thinking level escalation (think ‚Üí megathink ‚Üí ultrathink)
- Structured 4-loop maximum with forced breakthrough thinking
- Comprehensive debug logging (`debug_loop.md` files)
- Built-in problem classification and framework selection

**Best For:** Complex debugging challenges, systematic troubleshooting, breaking out of failed solution loops

---

### ü§ñ Multi-Agent Orchestration Evaluator
**Location:** `prompt-multi-agent-orchestration.evaluator/`

Comprehensive evaluator for multi-agent AI systems with 40+ quality criteria, modern framework support, and cost optimization analysis.

**Key Features:**
- 40-point evaluation framework covering architecture, performance, security
- Framework-aware analysis (AutoGen, LangGraph, CrewAI, etc.)
- Cost-benefit analysis with ROI projections
- Implementation roadmaps and compliance assessment

**Best For:** Enterprise AI systems, multi-agent architectures, production system optimization
