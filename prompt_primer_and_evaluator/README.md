# The Ultimate Prompt Evaluator (UPE) and Dual Path Primer

This directory contains two advanced meta-prompts: The Ultimate Prompt Evaluator (UPE) v2 and the Dual Path Primer.

## Ultimate Prompt Evaluator (UPE) v2

UPE is a meta-prompt that provides a 34-point evaluation of any prompt you provide it. It helps you understand the strengths and weaknesses of your prompts and how to improve them.

### Key Features:

*   **Instant Prompt Analysis:** Get a detailed breakdown of your prompt's effectiveness.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** Use the "re-evaluate" command to progressively improve your prompts.
*   **Concept-to-Prompt:** Describe a concept, and UPE can help you build a complete prompt.
*   **Broad Compatibility:** Works with prompts designed for various models and platforms.

### Getting Started:

1.  **Setup:** Add UPE to your AI chat platform. For Claude, you can use it as a main instruction. For ChatGPT or Gemini, paste it into a new chat.
2.  **First Evaluation:** Provide any prompt in quotes to see the 34-point breakdown.
3.  **Refine:** After the initial evaluation, you can ask UPE to refine the prompt for you.

## Dual Path Primer

The Dual Path Primer is another meta-prompt designed to deeply understand your requirements before a prompt is even written. When its output is fed into UPE, it results in highly refined and effective prompts.

## Techniques and Concepts

These prompts incorporate a wide range of prompt engineering techniques, including:

*   Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
*   Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
*   Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT)
*   Automatic Reasoning and Tool-use (ART)
*   And many others.

The prompts are designed to be platform-aware, with optimizations for Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini.
