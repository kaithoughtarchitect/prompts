# 20-Pillar Method: Context Engineer Apps

A systematic framework for transforming app concepts into comprehensive feature roadmaps through structured design thinking and strategic pillar selection.

## üéØ Overview

The 20-Pillar Method converts high-level app ideas into detailed, organized development blueprints. It provides a structured approach to breaking down complex applications into actionable components while maintaining strategic alignment throughout the design process.

**Core Value Proposition**: Rather than jumping straight into features, this method ensures you build on a solid strategic foundation by systematically exploring design dimensions and selecting what matters for your specific project.

---

## üîÑ Two Modes of Operation

**IMPORTANT**: When starting, specify which mode you want to use.

### Mode 1: AI-Guided (Automated)
The AI selects pillars and functions based on your app description.

**Best For:**
- Quick strategic overview
- Exploring possibilities
- Getting comprehensive coverage
- Time-sensitive projects
- Trusting AI judgment on relevance

**How to Use:**
- "Generate the complete blueprint for [your app idea] - you select the most relevant pillars and functions"
- The AI analyzes your app and makes strategic selections
- You receive the complete blueprint in one iteration

### Mode 2: Manual Selection (Interactive)
You choose each pillar and function yourself.

**Best For:**
- Precise control over scope
- Specific feature focus
- Learning the methodology
- Team collaboration and discussion
- Iterative refinement

**How to Use:**
- "Let's go through the 20-Pillar Method step by step for [your app idea]"
- Review generated pillars and select which ones to explore
- For each pillar, review functions and select which to include
- Build your custom blueprint progressively

---

## üìä How The System Works

### The Complete Process

1. **Input your app idea** ‚Üí Share your concept or detailed description
2. **Get 20 strategic design pillars** ‚Üí Comprehensive coverage of design strategy areas
3. **Choose your pillars** ‚Üí Select relevant ones (or let AI select)
4. **Drill down per pillar** ‚Üí Each expands into 10 specific functions
5. **Select your functions** ‚Üí Choose capabilities (or let AI select)
6. **Get organized blueprint** ‚Üí Structured development roadmap

### The Mathematics
- **20 Design Pillars** available
- **10 Functions per Pillar** = 200+ potential capabilities
- **Customized Selection** = Only what your app needs
- **Complete Blueprint** = Organized, hierarchical structure

---

## üèóÔ∏è Detailed Workflow

### Step 1: Generate Design Pillars
When you share your app idea, the system generates 15-20 strategic design pillars automatically.

**Example Output for "e-commerce mobile app":**

| #   | üé® **Design Pillar**           | üìù **Strategic Focus**                                                                                 |
|-----|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | **User-Centered Experience**   | Design with primary focus on user needs, behaviors, and pain points                                    |

**Your Action:**
- **Manual Mode**: *"I want to work with pillars 1, 6, and 7"*
- **AI Mode**: Skip - AI selects automatically

### Step 2: Explore Selected Pillars
For each pillar, the system generates 10 detailed implementation tasks.

**Example for "User-Centered Experience" Pillar:**

| #   | üîß **Design Task**              | üìù **Implementation Action**                                                                          |
|-----|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | **User Journey Mapping**        | Document complete user paths from discovery to purchase and beyond                                     |
| 2   | **Persona-Based Design**        | Create interfaces tailored to specific user types and their goals                                      |

## üí° Best Practices

### Getting Started Right

**For Manual Mode:**
- Start with a clear understanding of your app's primary purpose
- Review all 20 pillars before making selections
- Choose 3-5 pillars for initial iteration (don't overwhelm)
- Select functions that align with immediate development priorities
- Document why you chose specific pillars/functions

**For AI-Guided Mode:**
- Provide detailed app descriptions for better AI judgment
- Include target audience, core features, and business goals
- Mention any constraints or priorities upfront
- Review AI selections critically - adjust if needed

### Maximizing Value

**Input Quality:**
- Share comprehensive app idea descriptions from another chat
- Or explain your app idea in a few clear sentences
- Include target audience and core value proposition
- Mention technical constraints or platform requirements

**Process Execution:**
- Follow the pillar selection process systematically
- Don't rush - take time to understand each pillar
- Make all choices before moving to the next phase
- Keep notes on selection rationale

**Output Utilization:**
- Share blueprint with entire team for alignment
- Use as foundation for sprint planning
- Reference during design reviews
- Update iteratively as project evolves

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

‚ùå Selecting too many pillars initially (leads to scope creep)
‚ùå Skipping the detailed review of functions (misses important capabilities)
‚ùå Not documenting selection rationale (loses strategic context)
‚ùå Treating output as final rather than iterative (limits adaptability)
‚ùå Forgetting to specify your preferred mode (causes confusion)
