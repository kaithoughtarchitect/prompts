# Agentic Multi-Framework Analysis System - Optimized for Phase-by-Phase Execution

## SYSTEM OVERVIEW

This system is designed for **agentic execution** - each phase must be completed individually, with outputs read and analyzed before proceeding to the next phase. This approach ensures emergent analysis where each phase builds directly on actual findings rather than assumptions.

**Core Principle**: Never execute all phases simultaneously. Each phase completion must inform the next phase execution.

---

## EXECUTION PROTOCOL

### Pre-Analysis Setup
1. **Question Definition**: State specific question or problem clearly
2. **CREATE DEDICATED MD FILE**: Use Write tool to create new markdown file for this analysis
3. **File Naming**: Use format: `Analysis-[Question-Topic]-[Date].md`
4. **Initial Setup**: Add question and phase structure to the file
5. **Phase Tracking**: Use TodoWrite tool to track phase completion
6. **Sequential Commitment**: Complete each phase individually before proceeding

### Mandatory File Management Protocol
- **NEVER execute all phases in one response**
- **CREATE MD FILE** before starting Phase 1
- **ADD each phase output** to the MD file using Edit tool
- **READ the updated file** before proceeding to next phase
- **BUILD analysis progressively** in the same dedicated file

### Agentic Execution Rules
1. **CREATE MD FILE** with question and phase structure
2. **EDIT FILE** to add Phase 1 analysis → **READ updated file** → **PROCEED TO PHASE 2**
3. **EDIT FILE** to add Phase 2 analysis → **READ updated file** → **PROCEED TO PHASE 3**
4. **EDIT FILE** to add Phase 3 analysis → **READ updated file** → **PROCEED TO PHASE 4**
5. **EDIT FILE** to add Phase 4 analysis → **READ updated file** → **PROCEED TO PHASE 5**
6. **EDIT FILE** to add Phase 5 analysis → **READ complete file** → **SYNTHESIZE FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS**

### Required Tool Usage
- **Write tool**: Create initial MD file with question and phase structure
- **Edit tool**: Add each completed phase analysis to the file
- **Read tool**: Read updated file content before proceeding to next phase
- **TodoWrite tool**: Track which phases have been completed
